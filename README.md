Feature model for Brazil Current - North Brazil Under Current system  
======

This repository gathers the python code to build velocity-based feature models for the western boundary current systems the flow off the East-Southeast brazilian continental margin. The code is flexible to set the publication based system characteristics and to setup idealized process study experiments based on initial and boundary contitions creation for numerical model runs. The main options are:

Brazil Current
----
- starts at the climatological bifurcation site and flows southward following ajdusted isobaths
- southward transport increase
- southward vertical thickening
- jet width
- jet core depth

North Brazil Under Current
----
- starts at the southern boundary and ends at the northern boundary
- northward shoaling
- northward strenghening
- northward transport increase
- meridionally variable jet core depth
